opencv is available from
http://opencv.org/

On mac, you can just install it via homebrew:
Switch to the science repository first, then install
$ homebrew tap homebrew/science
$ homebrew install opencv

On linux, you might want to check if your distribution has a repository for opencv. Ubuntu has, afaik.

On windows, there download file is a .exe, so I assume it comes with an installer
